# season-long-shot-map

To collect the shot data, see the README for my shot_map repository. Compile all your shot data from as mant games as you like (doesn't have to be a single season's worth of games) into one Excel spreadsheet. Then change the filename in the second kernel and run the script to generate the shot map.
