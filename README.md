# season-long-shot-map

To collect the shot data, see the README for my shot_map repository.
To create the dataset for this shot map, aggregate your shot data from as many games as you like into one Excel spreadsheet. I would recommend no less than 7 games worth of shots to reduce the amount of noise in the xG measurement (https://medium.com/@Soccermatics/should-you-write-about-real-goals-or-expected-goals-a-guide-for-journalists-2cf0c7ec6bb6). Then change the filename in the second kernel of the jupyter notebook and run the script to generate the two shot maps. The last two kernels show some helpful stats that are great potential KPIs for your team. Just make sure that the KPIs you choose are ones that your players understand and that you can work on in training. As a coach, you want to avoid evaluating your players on something they never practiced in training.
