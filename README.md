# season-long-shot-map

To collect the shot data, see the README for my shot_map repository. Compile all your shot data from as many games as you like (doesn't have to be a single season's worth of games) into one Excel spreadsheet. Then change the filename in the second kernel and run the script to generate the shots taken and shots conceded shot maps. The last two kernels show some helpful stats that can be potential KPIs for your team.
